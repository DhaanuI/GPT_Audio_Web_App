# GPT_Zoom_Integration

GPT Zoom Integration
Congratulations on being selected to complete a Mercor project! We conduct final-round interviews for applicants with successful submissions to be a Mercor engineer. 

In this project, you will build a bot using Node.js which joins Zoom meetings, interprets verbal input from participants, and responds verbally using GPT. The bot will convert the voice input from Zoom into text, process the text using GPT, convert the text response back into spoken word, and feed the response back through Zoom. The end goal is to be able to speak to GPT over Zoom.

Requirements: 

1. Build a bot using Node.js which enters Zooms when provided with a meeting link. 

2. Implement speech-to-text which converts voice input from the Zoom meeting into text. 

3. Pass the text into GPT. 

4. Implement text-to-speech which converts the GPT response into speech which is passed through Zoom. 

5. Deploy your solution on a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages. The page should consist of a plain text box where users can input a Zoom meeting link for the bot to join. 

6. Record a YouTube video screensharing the bot responding to voice queries in Zoom to demonstrate your solution.
