# GPT_Audio_Web_App

Requirements: 

1. Build a bot using Node.js which accepts and processes voice input from a web application. 

2. Implement a voice-based user interface on the web application where users can speak their queries. 

3. Implement speech-to-text functionality which converts the voice input from the web application into text. 

4. The bot should recognize the silence after the user stops speaking as a trigger to start processing the voice input. 

5. Pass the converted text into GPT. 

6. Implement text-to-speech functionality which converts the GPT response into speech, and returns this audio response to the user through the web application once the input has been processed. 

7. Deploy your solution on a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages. The web application should include a voice input mechanism for user queries and an audio player for the GPT-generated spoken replies. 

8. Record a YouTube video screensharing the bot responding to voice queries on the web application to demonstrate your solution.
